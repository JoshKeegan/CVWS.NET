<p>A Computer Vision system capable of detecting word searches and using Atificial Intelligence techniques to solve them. It is open source (GPLv3 license), written in C# .NET and uses the <a href="http://www.aforgenet.com/">AForge.NET</a> and <a href="http://accord-framework.net/">Accord.NET</a> frameworks.</p>

<p>The project is released as libraries containing all of the code necessary to integrate a word search solver into your own software, and also as a fully functional desktop application which was built for demonstration. These can be found on the Downloads page.</p>

<a name="status" class="anchor" href="#status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h2>

<p>The system is in fully working order, with the library ready to be released as version 1. Work on a website and (very) basic documentation is in the early stages.
Until they are completed there are two resources that may be useful to anyone getting started with the library:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Design &amp; Implementation chapters of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/JoshKeegan/cvws.net/downloads/Dissertation%20Report.pdf">Dissertation Report</a> will help with understanding the roles of the various components and some of the algorithms used.</li>
<li>The DemoGUI Project is a working GUI for the library. The code is well commented and can be used as a reference. Anyone wanting to use the library in their own software should read through DemoGUI.MainForm.doProcessing() (in MainFormProcessing.cs).</li>
</ul><p>Until there is any documentation or a forum, I'll happily answer any queries via PM.</p>
