# CVWS.NET: Computer Vision Wordsearch Solver .NET #
A Computer Vision system capable of detecting word searches and using Atificial Intelligence techniques to solve them. It is open source (GPLv3 license), written in C# .NET and uses the [AForge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/) and [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) frameworks.
