# CVWS.NET: Computer Vision Wordsearch Solver .NET #
A Computer Vision system capable of detecting word searches and using Atificial Intelligence techniques to solve them. It is open source (GPLv3 license), written in C# .NET and uses the [AForge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/) and [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) frameworks.

The project is released as libraries containing all of the code necessary to integrate a word search solver into your own software, and also as a fully functional desktop application which was built for demonstration. These can be found on the Downloads page.

## Status ##
The system is in fully working order, with the library ready to be released as version 1. Work on a website and (very) basic documentation is in the early stages.
Until they are completed there are two resources that may be useful to anyone getting started with the library:

* The Design & Implementation chapters of the [Dissertation Report](https://bitbucket.org/JoshKeegan/cvws.net/downloads/Dissertation%20Report.pdf) will help with understanding the roles of the various components and some of the algorithms used.
* The DemoGUI Project is a working GUI for the library. The code is well commented and can be used as a reference. Anyone wanting to use the library in their own software should read through DemoGUI.MainForm.doProcessing() (in MainFormProcessing.cs).

Until there is any documentation or a forum, I'll happily answer any queries via PM.
