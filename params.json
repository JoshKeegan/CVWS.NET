{"name":"CVWS.NET","tagline":" A Computer Vision Wordsearch Solver written in C#","body":"# CVWS.NET: Computer Vision Wordsearch Solver .NET #\r\nA Computer Vision system capable of detecting word searches and using Atificial Intelligence techniques to solve them. It is open source (GPLv3 license), written in C# .NET and uses the [AForge.NET](http://www.aforgenet.com/) and [Accord.NET](http://accord-framework.net/) frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe project is released as libraries containing all of the code necessary to integrate a word search solver into your own software, and also as a fully functional desktop application which was built for demonstration. These can be found on the Downloads page.\r\n\r\n## License ##\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 Josh Keegan\r\n\r\nThis file is part of CVWS.NET (Computer Vision Wordsearch Solver .NET).\r\n\r\nCVWS.NET is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nCVWS.NET is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Work on a website and (very) basic documentation is in the early stages.\r\nUntil they are completed there are two resources that may be useful to anyone getting started with the library:\r\n\r\n* The Design & Implementation chapters of the [Dissertation Report](https://bitbucket.org/JoshKeegan/cvws.net/downloads/Dissertation%20Report.pdf) will help with understanding the roles of the various components and some of the algorithms used.\r\n* The DemoGUI Project is a working GUI for the library. The code is well commented and can be used as a reference. Anyone wanting to use the library in their own software should read through DemoGUI.MainForm.doProcessing() (in MainFormProcessing.cs).\r\n\r\nUntil there is any documentation or a forum, I'll happily answer any queries via PM.","google":"UA-53659461-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
